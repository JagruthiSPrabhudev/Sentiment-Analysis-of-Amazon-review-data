Really great, but...: I used this unit in my travel trailer for about a year before it was stolen. I ran my TV off it, laptop, and when tent camping used it for lights and my laptop and to recharge camera batteries.PROS: Does what it says. Solid; built like a Sherman tank. Idiot-proof. TV ran for about 3 hours, laptop about 4 hours, and 15 watt light...forever. Started my car instantly. Plugs high-quality, very solidly built.CONS: WAY heavy; incredibly heavy. Takes forever to recharge, even on car charger; don't believe the stats. The radio and light on the unit are useless and incredibly cheap.|1
