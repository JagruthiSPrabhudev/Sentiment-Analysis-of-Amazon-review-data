Horrible toy...: My daughter received this toy when she was about 11 months old and we eventually had to throw it in the garbage!!! Every single time she bumped into the wall or a piece of furniture it would nose dive and she would end up with her belly in the "v" section of the walker flying like superman! I can't tell you how many times the toy flipped over and she was hurt and crying hysterically! I am seriously shocked at how many people love this toy!! Obviously it is top heavy and not very safe for a new walker! My opinion is save your money and try a different push-ride on toy.|0
