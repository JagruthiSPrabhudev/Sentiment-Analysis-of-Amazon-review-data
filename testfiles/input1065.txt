Boring in the extreme: I have persisted for far too long with this dreary, long winded novel and have decided to stop torturing myself in this worthless effort, and closed the book once and for all on page 460 of 896.I still do so reluctantly, as I cannot remember a book so bad that I could not finish it, by one means or another, either by 'skimming' or jumping ahead.For my 'two cents' worth, don't waste your time, unless you have lots and lots to spare and don't mind meandering around with Dorothea (and the provincials) as George Elliot tries to provide a 'study' of Provincial life.In fairness to others, perhaps if it is approached and read as a 'study', it could be bearable, perhaps even an interesting one - I feel sorry for any schoolchild who had this as a set-book!|0
