Another Great Epic from Mr. Vidal: I just love the Narratives of Empire books from Mr. Vidal. This is the first book of these that I bought and fell in love with the story. Since then I have purchased the other books in the series and am just about finished with Empire and will be re-reading Hollywood next. For me I love the excursion to Hollywood of the silent era which I have done some reading on so much of what Mr. Vidal writes of I have read of before. It does help if you have a grasp not only of politics of the early part of the last century and of early Hollywood. Still if you have never heard of Warren G. Harding or D W Griffith you will still love the book because of Mr. Vidal's wonderful writing. His writing is so descriptive that you can see the places he writes about and his humor is such a treat. I would highly recommend these books to anyone and everyone.|1
