What a cool album...: Mark Isham has a gift for capturing, even setting, moods. His pieces evoke feelings and moods. Not quite background music but not quite music you actively listen to, his music allows parts of us to arise, giving us pause to reflect, to wander, to dream.This is the soundtrack for a great movie but the soundtrack stands on its own. It is exploratory and adventurous. There are several jazz/blues numbers on it but there is also some experimental music that is difficult to categorize. It is at once entrancing yet challening. That may sound a bit technical but the one word that describes the whole thing is 'cool', as in the jazz kind of cool.There aren't many like this one to find. That's what makes it so good. If you are looking for some creative and different music, this is a great place to wander.|1
