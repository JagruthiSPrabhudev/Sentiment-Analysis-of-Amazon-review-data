The "Citizen Kane" of Canadian Frat Movies: Just like my title said, this movie is the "Citizen Kane" of Canadian Frat Movies. It's ultra raunchy, made up of fart humor, vomit humor, getting people high at a funeral, among other things. It's politically incorrect, and darn proud of it. Catch it if you can.|1
