Pointless: If you read the book Jane Eyre you will soon understand the moral concept of what I am saying.When I bought this book I was hoping for a sequal. Instead Emma Tennant turned around all of Brontes work in to something awful and stupid. The worst part is they made Mrs. Fairfax the bad guy in this book. In Jane Eyre she was a good old lady servingthe house. But the way emma Tennant wrote the book she changed nearly half of what everything is supposed to be about.Also they rebuilt Thornfield. Confused? Look at the name. It was a place of terror that held to many memories that haunted people.|0
