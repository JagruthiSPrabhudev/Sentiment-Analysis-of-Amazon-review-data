Not as Good as the Original!!!: More American Graffiti is kind of sad to me. It shows how everone is living in 3 or 4 time zones. It's sad that Terry the toad's girlfriend forgets him and becomes a hippie. The ending is the most sad because you know John Milner is about to die because of a drunk driver. I probably wouldn't recommend MORE AMERICAN GRAFFITI!!!|0
