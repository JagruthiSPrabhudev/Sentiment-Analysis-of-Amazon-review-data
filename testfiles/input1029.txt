Rachel Wiesz is incredible!: I loved this movie, and that surprised me, because my tastes tend toward Bogart movies, or Gregory Peck or Audrey Hepburn. But this movie is wonderful! one minute you're scared out of your mind, and the next you are laughing. Not many movies can pull that off. Frasier is also solid (in my opinion) in his role. OK, so he's not Bogart, but still convincing in his charactar. Rachel Wiesz is nothing short of amazing! Of course, those big brown eyes do help! I think she has to be the most stunningly beautiful actress around. "The Mummy" is no classic, but its still worth the money for one wild ride!|1
