Boring, not very educational: My daughter has been playing with the Fisher Price Grand Piano which is by far better than this piano. Fisher Price Grand Piano has the keys light up, has different modes for music, learning (numbers 1-8, colors, pitch, and rhythm), also you can play the piano by tapping the individual keys.This particular Rock and Roll Piano doesn't light up, plays different types of musical instruments, but the keys aren't as fun to play. My daughter played it a few times and went straight back to the Grand Piano. Consider buying that one instead.|0
