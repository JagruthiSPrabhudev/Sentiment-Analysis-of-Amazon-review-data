Unreliable and Unpredicatable.: This product is unrellibale and unpredictable. Multiple problems; makes a full cup intermittently. You never know when you get a full cup or a half cup. It also deposits coffee rinds in the cup of coffee, intermittently. Lastly after using this product for about 10 days, it stopped working. The word Prime displayed on the screen, and followed manufacturer's recommended guidelines to correct, which it did for about 3 cups and then stopped working. The only thing that works; it makes noise like a constant motor running and would not shut off, nor does it make coffee. Don't buy this piece of junk.|0
