Works Great: Tripp Lite INTERNET550SER 550VA UPS Compact Low Profile Standby 8 outlets w/ DB9 PortWe have been using our Tripp 550SER since October 2008. It meets our expectations for a great surge and small back up power supply. It would be nice if there were an option to turn off the beep alarm when the standby power is running.This is a great unit.|1
