Mummy...the ultimate movie!: I really loved this movie, i remember seeing it the next day after star wars come out and loving the fact it is a new Indiana jones type movie, sure there has been many tries at those type but this movie is dead on, only missing doctor jones. The movie is not scary but a load of fun and a good adventure. if you have the regular dvd then skip this and save your money as it's not enough extras to make it worth it the mummy returns is out on dvd soon so the spotlight on it here is not worth it.but if you don't have the mummy yet on dvd then get this one since it's both widescreen and fullscreen and the extras are nice.|1
