Amazing product: This is a cool product, so far I don't have any problems with this. It charges my Iphone, and any other small units. I haven't tried this in a long drive yet but I'll give you guys an update when I drive from NY to TX this summer. Well, so far so good!Cons: The only thing I notice is that you can't really tell if it's "on" since the "ON" button's light is unnoticeable, it is just useless unless you try to wrap your hands around it to dim the area. BUt I still would recommend it to anyone I know!|1
