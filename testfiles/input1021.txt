shafi: I have been looking for a book for my children to share thorugh illustrations and imagination the stories of my childhood when it came to the Legend of the Old Befana. I found this to be the closest so far yet it does not follow through on the tradion that follows the Befana each year in Italy. It did not captivate my our my son and I found myself having to more explaining than sharing The drawings are nice though.|0
