WILL NEVER PURCHASE USED AGAIN: I have been searching for a fishbowl crib toy for my daughter for a while now. I came across this particular one, and the seller 100% GUARANTEED my satisfaction! BULL! Seller claimed that all toys were tested prior to shipping, guess they forgot this one?? The entire right side has no working bubbles, the big fish in the middle does not move at all. Seller also claimed there were no scratches or marks, yet theres a scratch on the bottom, and what looks like yellow and pink marker on it. I am so disappointed its unreal!!!|0
