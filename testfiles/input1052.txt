Don't go home from the hospital without it!: This was the one thing that would soothe our son when we brought him home from the hospital. He is 3 months old now and sleeping through the night. When he wakes up he starts to kick and swing his arms and he accidentally turns the aquarium on. He falls right back to sleep! The aquarium will only stay on for 5 minutes. This was not long enough when he was a newborn. I would have to stay in the room for 5 minutes to turn it back on. He likes the ocean sounds better than the music and the louder the better.|1
