Could have been........: With gleeful anticipation I purchased this cd hoping to hear some wonderful reinditions of some excellent songs. Boy, was I dissappointed!There are twelve cuts on this cd, everything from Joan Armatrading to Blondie. Clearly the best cut here is a wonderful cover of John Hiatt's "Have a Little Faith in Me". After that, Carly Simon's "Anticipation" and E.John's "Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters" round out all that is worthy of mention on this cd. Skip everything else. Besides a poor selection of songs and an even poorer performance, there is a feeling of being rushed through the music presented here. This just destroys any connection with the songs. A little less pace would have given more of a feel for the songs here. The quintiessential cover cd of the year is Michael McDonald's "Motown", this could have been in that league. But it isn't, skip it and wait for the next effort.|0
