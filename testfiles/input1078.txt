It does have a story, sort of: Repetitious. I lasted one hour watching this before I left the room. My spouse was able to watch it to the end and enjoy the story underneath.I gave Moulin Rouge one star, partly because of the shrill grating voices. At least Dream Girls has more natural voices. And it was fun to see how different performers of the era were represented by these fictional characters. And there was at least one educational piece of historical information: Elvis was not the original singer for Hound Dog. It was Big Mama Thornton, but her version was suppressed by mainstream white radio.|0
