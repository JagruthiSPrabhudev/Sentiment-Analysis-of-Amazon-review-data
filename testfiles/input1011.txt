Keurig B70: I am very pleased with my Keurig B70. It easy and fast to use. I love the different varieties of coffee and tea offered. I now can enjoy a cup of coffee or tea anytime during the day without the hassles of a conventional coffee maker and so I do. I do miss it when out of town. I am considering getting one for my small office staff so they and I can enjoy it at work.|1
