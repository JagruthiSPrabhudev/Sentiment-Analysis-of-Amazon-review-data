Best toy I ever purchased: Kasey the Kinderbot is truly the best toy I ever purchased! I have a 3 year old girl and an 8 year old boy and both love it. It really does make learning fun for both of them. Both have used it constantly. Luckily, my son is gone to school all day.I had the 2XL Robot as a kid and this is basically the same thing but even better. Better get yours sooner rather than later. This toy will most likely be the HOT toy for this Christmas season.|1
