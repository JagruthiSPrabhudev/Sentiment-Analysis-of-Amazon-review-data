The only...: I ordered this book simply to replace the original book that has come unbound from years of use. I've been reading cards for close to 25 years now. My first deck was given to by my mother when I was an adolescent. I've come across many decks over the years, and have yet to find one that compares to the "Old Path". I mostly work with oracle cards now, however I use the tarot for precise information. The Old Path refers to pre-Christian era, when the Goddess was the divine deity. The cards are beyond beautiful and definitely feminine without being feminist. They have a beautiful balance between male and female. The cards relay precise information without being too harsh. These are my tarot for life. BLESSED BE!|1
