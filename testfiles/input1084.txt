Awesome CD: This was a great solo debut for Chris Cornell. I still cant believe that people are comparing it to Soundgarden, though. IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE SOUNDGARDEN. Somebody actually started bashing it because it wasnt like Badmotorfinger. There was noticable change from Screaming Life and FOPP to Badmotorfinger, then change from there to Superunknown, and then further change to Down on the Upside. Why in the heck would you think this album would sound like Badmotorfinger. I love the growth his music has taken. Great Job.|1
