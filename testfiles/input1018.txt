Tried to like it...: As a huge fan of early Stephen King works, I had heard that this was so much like "IT" and "The Stand" and so I was excited about reading it. In my opinion it was totally vulgar and I don't think that all that vulgarity was necessary to create the story. I found the book to be confusing as well, towards the end. There were times when I had to stop reading it as I felt sick to my stomach....maybe that's a good thing??!! King is still in my opinion an extremly great writer but I thinkat times he tries too hard to be gross. All in all, I was disappointed...hopefully the next one will be better...|0
