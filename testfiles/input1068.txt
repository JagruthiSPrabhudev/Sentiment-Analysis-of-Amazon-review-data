Their Best: The Beatles released many fine albums during the 60s, but "Magical Mystery Tour" was their finest. There is not a single weak track on this record. The Beatles never released an album with as many #1 hits as "Magical Mystery," including "Penny Lane," "All You Need Is Love," and "Hello, Goodbye." The other songs aren't bad either. "Strawberry Fields Forever" is the best song John ever wrote, while the title track and "Fool On the Hill" are enough to make an album gold or platinum for another rock group. While the film was a colossal flop, the soundtrack shows psychedlic rock at its best.|1
