as ugly as it gets: UFC 43 is a joke of an event. There is only one good fight which is the main event. The rest of the card is saved for no namers or fat has-beens such as Kimo and Tank. You can tell that all these guys have very little skill compared to the guys in Pride and sometimes are akin to fat barroom brawlers.Pride FC is the top organization in the world. Sadly, the UFC is far behind.|0
