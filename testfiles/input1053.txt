who picked the music...???: we had bought the previous model of this crib toy for our older son, but some of the moving parts had frozen over time in storage, so we decided to replace it since he loved it so much. that version had happy, cheerful nursery songs. the new version plays an almost eerie, creepy, surreal-type music that actually made my youngest son cry! it's a good thing the new model comes with a silent mode (bubble sounds) or we would've returned it.visually, the toy is mesmerizing and my son likes it as long as we don't play the music.|0
