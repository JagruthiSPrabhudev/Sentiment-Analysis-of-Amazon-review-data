Worst coffee maker: I bought the keurig about 2 years ago and without fail the company has had to send me a new one every 6 months. The brewer works great for about 1 to 2 months and then goes down hill from there. Read all the reviews, look at the time frame the people have owned them! The good reviews are from the people who have owned them for 2 months or less! They have sent me 4....thats right 4!!!! replacement brewers and all do the same thing! Customer service has to go through the same process every time, I think I know them by name now. They defend this piece of junk and the bad ratings by saying they sell so many of them that they have to expect some problems....really....YOU ARE CHARGING $160 BUCKS!!!!! This brewer is a piece of crap....look at the Hamilton Beach instead....SignedKeurig Sucks!|0
