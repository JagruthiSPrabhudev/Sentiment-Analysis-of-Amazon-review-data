A Very Difficult Book from which to Learn HTML: I have now struggled with this book for many hours, and I am still in ignorance of such basic things as "where is white space allowed in HTML," "when is it case-sensitive, if ever," and "when are double quotes required and when not." This book may or may not be a good reference -- I can't tell -- but if you are trying to get started, it is not the right book.|0
