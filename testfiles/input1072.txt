A Headache of a Vacuum: The thing burned through belts. One time I replaced 2 belts in one vacuuming session--and yes I installed them properly and they weren't rubbing against anything.My guess is that it's the quality of the belts--or should I say lack of quality.Even after two years, the vacuum, when ran, would fill the house with a hot rubber smell.The tubes were also prone to clogging and I've had to pull it apart numerous times to push dust clogs through so it would work properly.After two years, the vacuum just stopped when the motor burned out. I did us a favor.The cord retractor was neat; at least they got that part right.|0
