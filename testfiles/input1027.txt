Not "Great" but a "Good" one!: All right - I admit, the movie is good: Good jokes, good action, good sound, A-M-A-Z-I-N-G special effects, a little bit of frightning here, a little bit of frightning there.. Well, ok, so what this a "4 star movie" and not "5 star"? It's resemblance to Indiana Jones! I know it's a totaly different story and all, but I can't help it - It's just too similar in the music, the places shown and the characters..|1
